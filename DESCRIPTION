Description: Provides a streamlined and user-friendly workflow for the end-to-end
    analysis of transcriptomic data. 'omicScope' leverages the SummarizedExperiment 
    class for robust data management and offers a suite of tools for essential analysis
    steps, including data normalization, differential expression analysis (interfacing 
    with popular methods like DESeq2, edgeR, and limma), and advanced functional 
    interpretation. A key feature is the implementation of pathway and transcription 
    factor (TF) activity inference using the 'decoupleR' framework, enabling users 
    to move from gene expression changes to functional biological insights within a 
    single, cohesive environment..
