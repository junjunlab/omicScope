\usage{
activity_plot(object, ...)

\S4method{activity_plot}{omicscope}(
  object,
  top_tf = 20,
  target_pathway = NULL,
  target_tf = NULL,
  complexHeatmap_params = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{omicscope} object containing activity data in the
\code{@activityData} slot. Activity data must be generated first using
\code{infer_activity()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used)}

\item{top_tf}{Integer. Number of top variable transcription factors to display
when \code{infer_type = "tf"}. For multi-sample data, selects TFs with highest
standard deviation across samples. For single-sample data, selects top and
bottom scoring TFs. Default is 20.}

\item{target_pathway}{Character vector. Specific pathway names to visualize.
When provided for single-sample data, creates scatter plots showing pathway
weights vs. gene statistics. Only used when \code{infer_type = "pathway"}.}

\item{target_tf}{Character vector. Specific transcription factor names to visualize.
When provided for single-sample data, creates scatter plots showing TF regulation
modes vs. differential expression. Only used when \code{infer_type = "tf"}.}

\item{complexHeatmap_params}{List. Additional parameters to pass to
\code{ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()} function when creating heatmaps for
multi-sample data. Default is an empty list.}
}
\value{
Returns different plot objects depending on the data type and parameters:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Multi-sample data}: A \code{ComplexHeatmap} object showing activity
scores across samples (z-score normalized)
\item \strong{Single-sample data (overview)}: A \code{ggplot} object showing
activity scores as horizontal bar chart
\item \strong{Single-sample data (specific targets)}: A \code{cowplot} grid
combining multiple scatter plots for specified pathways or TFs
}
}
\description{
Create visualizations for biological activity inference results, including pathway
activities and transcription factor activities. The function automatically adapts
the plot type based on the number of samples and inference type.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# First perform activity inference
os <- infer_activity(os, input_type = "counts", infer_type = "pathway")

# Basic pathway activity visualization
activity_plot(os)

# TF activity with more top factors
os_tf <- infer_activity(os, infer_type = "tf", statistics = "ulm")
activity_plot(os_tf, top_tf = 40)

# Specific pathway detailed view (single-sample data)
activity_plot(os, target_pathway = c("p53", "MAPK"))

# Specific TF detailed view (single-sample data)
activity_plot(os_tf, target_tf = c("Pou5f1", "Mef2a"))

# Custom heatmap parameters for multi-sample data
activity_plot(os, complexHeatmap_params = list(
  cluster_rows = FALSE,
  show_row_names = TRUE,
  row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)
