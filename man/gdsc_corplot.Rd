\title{Generate Correlation Plot Between Gene Expression and Drug IC50}
\usage{
gdsc_corplot(
  select_gene = NULL,
  drug_name = NULL,
  point_col = "#ED3500",
  point_size = 1,
  lm_col = "#0A5EB0"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{select_gene}{Character string. Name of the gene to analyze. Must match
gene names in the expression dataset.}

\item{drug_name}{Character string. Name of the drug to analyze. Must match
drug names in the IC50 dataset. Use \code{check_dugs()} to see available drugs.}

\item{point_col}{Character string. Color for scatter plot points.
Default is "#ED3500" (red).}

\item{point_size}{Numeric. Size of scatter plot points. Default is 1.}

\item{lm_col}{Character string. Color for the linear regression line.
Default is "#0A5EB0" (blue).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the correlation between gene expression
(log2 transformed) and drug IC50 values (log2 transformed). The plot
includes scatter points, linear regression line, and correlation statistics.
}
\description{
This function creates correlation plots showing the relationship between
gene expression levels and drug IC50 values using GDSC (Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer) data.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads IC50 and gene expression data
\item Filters data for the specified gene and drug
\item Matches samples between expression and IC50 datasets
\item Creates scatter plot with log2 transformed values
\item Adds linear regression line and correlation statistics
}

Both gene expression and IC50 values are log2 transformed with +1 added
to handle zero values. IC50 values are converted from natural log to
original scale before log2 transformation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First check available drugs
check_dugs()
# load ic50 data
data("ic.rda")

# load gene expression data
data("exp.anno.rda")

# Create correlation plot
gdsc_corplot(select_gene = "TP53",
             drug_name = "Cisplatin",
             point_col = "#ED3500",
             point_size = 1.5,
             lm_col = "#0A5EB0")
}
