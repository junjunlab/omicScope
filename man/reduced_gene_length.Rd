\title{Calculate the Reduced (Non-redundant) Length of Genes}
\usage{
reduced_gene_length(gtf = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf}{A \code{GRanges} object, typically imported from a GTF or GFF file.
It must contain metadata columns named 'type' (to filter for "exon") and
'gene_id' (for grouping).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with two columns:
\item{gene_id}{Character, the unique gene identifier.}
\item{length}{Integer, the calculated non-redundant exonic length for that gene.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the total non-redundant length of all exons
associated with each gene. It first groups exons by gene, then merges any
overlapping or adjacent exons into a single feature, and finally sums the
widths of these merged features to get a single length value per gene.
