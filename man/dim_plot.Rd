\title{Create Dimensionality Reduction Scatter Plot}
\usage{
dim_plot(object, ...)

\S4method{dim_plot}{omicscope}(object, reduction = c("pca", "umap", "tsne"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{omicscope} S4 object containing dimensionality reduction results.
The object must have reduction data in the \code{reduction} slot
(run \code{run_reduction} first).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used).}

\item{reduction}{Character string specifying which dimensionality reduction to plot.
Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"pca"} - Principal Component Analysis scatter plot (PC1 vs PC2)
\item \code{"umap"} - UMAP scatter plot (currently not implemented)
\item \code{"tsne"} - t-SNE scatter plot (currently not implemented)
}
Default is \code{c("pca","umap","tsne")}, which will use "pca" as the first choice.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing the PCA scatter plot with samples colored
by sample names.
}
\description{
This function creates a scatter plot visualization of dimensionality reduction
results stored in an omicscope object. Currently only supports PCA plotting.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run dimensionality reduction first
obj <- normalize_data(obj)
obj <- run_reduction(obj, reduction = "pca")

# Create PCA plot
p <- dim_plot(obj, reduction = "pca")
print(p)

# The plot can be further customized with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
p + labs(title = "My PCA Analysis") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
}
