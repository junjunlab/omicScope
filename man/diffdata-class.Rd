\title{An S4 Class to Store Differential Expression Analysis Results}
\description{
The \code{diffdata} class is designed to store and organize results from
differential expression analysis, including statistical parameters,
significance thresholds, and summary statistics.
}
\details{
The \code{diffdata} class provides a structured way to store differential
expression analysis results along with the parameters and summary statistics.
This allows for easy tracking of analysis parameters and quick access to
summary information without recalculating from the raw results.

The \code{data} slot should contain a data.frame with gene/feature identifiers
as row names and statistical results as columns. Common columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{log2FoldChange} - Log2 fold change values
\item \code{pvalue} - Raw p-values
\item \code{padj} - Adjusted p-values (e.g., FDR, Bonferroni)
\item \code{baseMean} - Base mean expression levels
\item \code{stat} - Test statistics
}
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{contrastName}}{A character string specifying the name of the contrast
or comparison being analyzed (e.g., "Treatment_vs_Control", "GroupA_vs_GroupB").}

\item{\code{method}}{A character string indicating the statistical method used for
differential expression analysis (e.g., "DESeq2", "edgeR", "limma", "t-test").}

\item{\code{design}}{A list containing the experimental design information, including
factors, covariates, and design matrix specifications used in the analysis.}

\item{\code{log2FCthreshold}}{A numeric value specifying the log2 fold change threshold
used to determine statistical significance (typically 0, 0.5, or 1).}

\item{\code{pvalueThreshold}}{A numeric value specifying the p-value or adjusted p-value
threshold used to determine statistical significance (typically 0.01, 0.05).}

\item{\code{sigUp}}{An integer indicating the number of significantly upregulated
genes/features (positive log2FC above threshold and p-value below threshold).}

\item{\code{sigDown}}{An integer indicating the number of significantly downregulated
genes/features (negative log2FC below threshold and p-value below threshold).}

\item{\code{nonSig}}{An integer indicating the number of non-significant genes/features
that do not meet the specified thresholds.}

\item{\code{data}}{A data.frame containing the complete differential expression results,
typically including columns such as log2FoldChange, pvalue, padj, baseMean, etc.}
